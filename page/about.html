					<p>When I think about describing myself a lot of words come to mind. I'm tenacious, hardworking, studious, creative, a dreamer, but removed from these
					   cliched terms I think of myself, above all else, as an explorer. Perhaps not in the traditional sense of venturing across the seas or 
					   discovering new lands, but more of a mental adventurer. Places people can't fathom I've been to and back numerous times in my mind. I've conquered 
					   worlds, concepts, and challenges so far out of the reach of the physical world that they border on the absurd. Many may address this statement as
					   outlandish or childish, and I don't deny it, but maybe it is this outlandishness that generates new and revolutionary ideas (or at least I hope that's the
					   case: if not I've wasted a hell of a lot of time). But until we find the answer to that quandary I'll continue down my path of childishness and I 
					   invite you to come along, maybe we can learn a thing or two together.<br><br>Always exploring, <br> Navid Boloorian <br><br>
