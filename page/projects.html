					<h1>2VUE Podcast</h1>
					<p>Podcast created by my friend Shawn Ratanpal and myself. The podcast is a casual conversational with topics such as politics, comedy, and 
					   our general lives among other things. The 2VUE Podcast can be found on Spotify, Anchor, and other platforms where podcasts are found.

					<a href = "https://newviewnews.com"><h1>NewViewNews.com</h1></a>
					<p>NewViewNews.com is a website I programmed from scratch meant to be a place where opinions from all sides can be heard and discussed. The concept
					   depends on users to write their own articles that can then be responded to and "spun-off" to provide all the perspectives on different matters; making
					   sure that partisan-bias does not sway opinions. The site is still a work-in-progress but shows a lot of potential.

					<a href = "https://newviewnews.com/EmotionTeam/index.html"><h1>&Sigma;-Motion Team Website</h1></a>
					<p>Website I programmed for the local robotics team from scratch.
					</p>
					<h1>Machine Learning Projects</h1></a>
					<p>Using Python in conjunction with linear-regression algorithms I've put together numerous proof-of-concept AI and machine learning prototypes. These prototypes
					   test evolutionary algorithms and visual recognition among other things.
