					<h1>Programming</h1>
					<p>I've been programming for going-on six years now. Over this time, I've realized that programming is potentially the most valuable tool
					   that you can have at your fingertips. I've programmed everything from applications (both computer and phone) and websites to games and
					   other interactive experiences. I'm well versed in HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQLi, Java, and Python.
					</p>
					<h1>Comedy</h1>
					<p>As much as I love programming, it doesn't even come into the same conversation as comedy for me. Comedy is not only a skill of mine, it 
					   is also my primary passion. I'm the captain of an improv team and do stand up in my free time.
					</p>
					<h1>Leadership</h1>
					<p>I've spent a large portion of my life being a leader (willing or unwilling). I've honed my skills and communicative abilities to a fine point
					   where I am able to defuse problems and confidently head a group and drive them towards their/our goals. 
					</p>
					<h1>Logical Thinking</h1>
					<p>I pride myself on my logical thinking and objectivity. This contributes to many of my other skills as I am able to frame each situation 
					   completely independent of others, this allows for decisive and fair decision making that, more often than not, results in a beneficial outcome.
					</p>
					<h1>To be continued...</h1>
					<p>This list is hardly exhaustive and I will continue to spend the rest of my life looking to add to it, being content is not an option.
